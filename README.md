# Dark Vector Doublet Model (DVDM)

This repository holds all the information that served for the construction of the DVDM project. In here we explore an extension to the Standard Model which incorporates a vector field in the fundamental representation of SU(2)_L as the only nonstandard degree of freedom. This kind of field may appear in different scenarios such as compositeness, gauge-Higgs unification, and extradimensional scenarios. We study the model in which a Z2 symmetry is manifiest, making the neutral CP-even component of the new vector field a vectorial dark matter candidate. We constraint the parameter space through LEP and LHC data, as well as from current dark matter searches. Additionally, comments on the implications of perturbative unitarity are presented. We find that the model is highly constrained but a small region of the parameter space can provide a viable DM candidate. On the other hand, unitarity demands an UV completion at an scale below 10 TeV. Finally we contrast our predictions on mono-jet, -Z, -Higgs production with the ones obtained in the inert two Higgs doublet model.
